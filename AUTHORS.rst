Development Lead
================

* Markus Juenemann (markus@juenemann.net)


Contributors
============

* Eliot Blennerhassett contributed code, lots of really good ideas and reminded me that other people may use *python-TSIP* in ways I hadn't even anticipated.
* Thanks to Jonathan Eisch for making me `re-start working on this project again` ;-)
* The code for reading TSIP data is a largely based on the code found 
  at `Brad's *Duino Blog: Python Code to Read & Parse TSIP Data from a Copernicus II GPS Module on an Arduino Yun`_.
